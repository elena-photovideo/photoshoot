            <h2>My camera: frame by frame</h2>
            <p>My name is Elena. I am a photographer.</p>

            <div class="container">

                <p>I believe that everyone sees the world in their own way. I am no exception. Many things enchant and inspire me, but especially people. I see in each person their uniqueness: not only their outward beauty, but also their inner beauty, the beauty of their soul.<br><br>

		   My life is full of professional experience: studying at university with a technical specialty, working in large companies, participating in various competitions. But beyond that, I've always had a hobby - the world of art has always attracted me: theater, books, and of course, photography.
<br><br>

		   Photography has always fascinated me, and I've always had a camera with me. The camera has given me the opportunity to get to know people better, to learn their thoughts, fears, and desires.<br><br>

		   Studying at Zotov's Photography School and the "Philosophy of Portraiture" course, I became convinced that I was on the right track. Because during my photo shoots, I strive to create more than just photographs; I aim to reveal the individuality of each person.<br><br>

		   Currently, I specialize in portrait photography, lifestyle photography, and walk-and-shoot sessions. I enjoy working in a comfortable atmosphere, so my clients feel relaxed and confident in front of the camera.<br><br>

		   I use only professional equipment in my work and process photographs in my individual style. A photo shoot typically lasts about an hour.<br><br>

		  Visit the gallery of my works on the main page of the site. Here you can see a selection of my work, showcasing some incredibly beautiful people. Look at them as I see them.<br><br>

		  If you want to see yourself through my eyes, I invite you to try my photo shoot. I promise you'll forget about any worries and anxieties right away. Time will fly by, and you'll be left with vivid memories and sensual photographs full of genuine emotions. Write to me on WhatsApp. Right now!</p>
